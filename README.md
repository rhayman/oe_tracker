Open source modules for tracking of animal behavior and closed-loop stimulation based on Open Ephys and Bonsai. Open Ephys plugin for tracking experiments and closed-loop stimulation. 

This is an adaptation of the repo found here https://github.com/open-ephys-plugins/tracking-plugin to be compliant with the latest plugin-GUI release (0.6.*). Currently only the Tracking Node and Tracking Visualizer are available i.e. no Tracking Stimulator yet.

Please refer to the wiki https://github.com/CINPLA/tracking-plugin/wiki for detailed documentation.
